# 🚀 JavaScript Advanced Concepts

This repository contains examples that explore advanced JavaScript concepts including the event loop, promises, async/await, and object comparison techniques.

## ⏱️ Event Loop Examples

### Event Loop 1: [event-loop-1.js](event-loop-1.js)

Demonstrates the basic interaction between setTimeout callbacks, promises, and their execution order in the JavaScript event loop.

### Event Loop 2: [event-loop-2.js](event-loop-2.js)

Illustrates how async functions interact with promises and setTimeout in the event loop, showing more complex execution flow patterns.

### Event Loop 3: [event-loop-3.js](event-loop-3.js)

Provides a comprehensive example with nested promises, async/await patterns, and multiple setTimeout callbacks to demonstrate the complete event loop priority system.

## 🔄 Object Comparison

### Shallow vs Deep Compare: [shallow-compare-vs-deep-compare.js](shallow-compare-vs-deep-compare.js)

Demonstrates the difference between shallow equality checks (`===`, `==`) and deeper comparison approaches using `Object.is()`.

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- 🔹 Microtask Queue (Promises, async/await)
- 🔹 Macrotask Queue (setTimeout, setInterval)
- 🔹 Event Loop Execution Order
- 🔹 Object References vs Value Comparison
- 🔹 Promise Chaining
- 🔹 Async/Await Patterns
